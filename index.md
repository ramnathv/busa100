## Boarding: Back-To-Front

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CsRfFhrNtho?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*** pnotes

### Back-to-Front and Rotating-Zone

The main disadvantage here is is that you are boarding only a small section of the airplane. Imagine boarding back-to-front five rows at a time, that is, thirty passengers are trying to get seated in five rows all at the same time. Clearly, this is not going to work out well and passengers will line up in the aisle waiting for other passengers to get seated. When the next group is called, their row (section) will most likely still be completely blocked by passenger who boarded in the group before them. On top of this, passengers may have to get out of their seats in order for other passengers, seated closer to window, to reach their seats. This will clog the aisle even more, and the aisle is your most important resource when boarding an airplane.

## Ordering T-Shirts for Frosh

Your group is responsible for purchasing and selling these designs at Frosh. Assume that the market  consists of your classmates in this course. Each shirt costs $2 and sells at $10. The total number of shirts is fairly certain (the number of groups), but the mix is uncertain. All unsold shirts are scrapped with no salvage value. The objective is to maximize profits. Discuss with your group and report how many shirts of each design you will order?

<div class='build'>
 <p>Jot down your answer in the following format: Group, #Black, #Blue, #Red</p>
 <p style='font-size:40px'><strong>OMisCool, 15, 15, 15</strong></p>
</div>

## Choosing Test Stores

<img class=center src=assets/img/test_design.png width=90% />

--- .large

## Typical Testing Process

> - Choose 25 average stores e.g. average sales rate
> - Place product in those stores for 4 weeks
> - Forecast chain season sales by extrapolation.

## Predicted vs. Actual Sales (Typical)

## New Testing Process

> - Cluster stores based on similarity of sales mix.
> - Choose most representative store from each cluster.
> - Fit formula that most accurately predicts season sales
